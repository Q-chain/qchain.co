            On March 1st, 2019, the Delaware corporation Qchain Co. transferred its custom content marketplace and other associated intellectual property to the Singapore-based company <a href="https://www.ad360.io">Ad360</a>, which will operate the marketplace and continue its development under the new name of <a href="https://brandledger.tech">BrandLedger</a>. Qchain Co. and its original team are no longer active, so proceed to BrandLedger for updated information about the marketplace. Qchain's former team is proud of the work it has done building one of the first blockchain-powered content marketplaces, and wishes Ad360 the best of luck in its future expansion and development.
